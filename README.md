# TinyFan

TinyFan is an fan expansion board for the RAMPS 3D printer control board. It allows control of two additional fans through pins D6 and D11.

TinyFan is designed to be easy to install. It plugs directly into RAMPS - no soldering is required. A screw terminal allows for connection to 12/24V, so two short wires can be run from RAMPS power input screw terminals to the TinyFan board. This also allows TinyFan to operate at a different voltage to the main power supplied to RAMPS.

Standard .1" pin headers are used for fan connections.

TinyFan is open source, and licensed under the GPL V3. TinyFan was designed in Altium Designer, which may make it difficult for some to access - gerber files (for manufacturing) and PDF files (for schematic) have been included to attempt to address this.
